App to track your transactions and budget

## What do I want to do
- App that lets you add bank accounts (checking, credit and savings)
- You can input transactions into those accounts
- you can view your full balance among all the accounts
- the info gets saved on a database
- you can only access your data after being authorized (maybe Auth0)
- You can add transactions (deposit checks, spend money and transfer between different accounts)

## Technologies

### Frontend
- HTML
- CSS (Probably Bootstrap may change to a different framework later)
- Vanilla JS (Need to use AJAX)
- Auth0

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MySQL
